What is SCONE
-------------

SCONE stands for **S**\ tochastic **C**\ alculator **O**\ f **N**\ eutron Transport **E**\ quation and  
it is a Monte Carlo particle transport code, like its more famous cousins Serpent, 
MCNP, OpenMC ,MCS, MONK, Tripoli, MORET, RMC and many others. Naturally, the existance of so many good and 
established Monte Carlo codes can make anybody question the need for **yet** another code. 
However, most of the MC codes are proprietary and access to them is quite limited. Moreover most 
of them strive for maximum performance, which can reduce a readibilty of their source code for 
a novice user unexperianced with programming. In our view, this creates a niche for a highly flexible 
and easy-to-modify MC neutron transport code, that would allow very novice users like Master and 
PhD students to test new approches to preforming Monte Carlo calculations, even if they have no 
privuous significant programming background. This is of paramount importance in the context of British 
Masters programmes that last only a single year, so it is necessary a for student to get a grasp of 
their programming enviroment quickly in order to be able to do any significant work on their project. 



.. Things are 
.. made worse if one wants to investigate new MC algorithms or solution techniques. Often source code 
.. is unavalible and even when it is, a novice user, unexperianced with programming, can find it very 
.. intimidating. 


 especially if 
somebody is interesed in implementations details and requires an acces to the source code.       

For the british people out there, we would like to stress that we do not have a prefered pronunciation
both the *tone* and *gone* rhyme is perfectly fine. It is however a strong opinion of this author that 
the jam goes on top of clotted cream!
